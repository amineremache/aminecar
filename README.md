This repository contains the code for a webapp to control any picar model.
The repo is forked from [noahcar](https://github.com/james4388/noahcar)


# autoRC
Street is danger, why not making autonomous toy?

Autonomous Remote Controlled (toy) car using deep learning. Raspberry Pi, PiCar, Python

You can find hardware on [here](https://www.sunfounder.com/free/p1429u49266), I'm too lazy to build from scratch.

![PiCar](/docs/assets/picar-front.jpg)

## Design
Inspired by Robot Operating System ([ROS](http://www.ros.org/)) each components is a Node and run in it own process. A Node can be sensors, controller, motion planner, camera, Deep Learning pilot... which talk to each other via pub/sub like system.

![PiCar](/docs/assets/noaharch.png)

Current implementation using Python's built in multiprocessing manager that allow sharing objects, data between Processes. Pros: Utilize CPU cores, avoid PIL, run nodes over network from different machine. Cons: Data are being pickle/unpickle multiple time and send over network which is slower than thread. May consider using more decend message queue like Redis.

## Requirement
- Raspberry Model 2/3 or greater
- Python 3.5
- OpenCV (optional) or PyGame camera (just for capture video)
- SD card 8gb or more
- Car kit (robot HAT, mortor controller... mine just use picar)
- Webcam or Picamera

## Documents
1. Setup Hardware
  - [Raspberry Pi setup](/docs/rasp-setup.md)
  - [Car setup](/docs/car-setup.md)
2. [Setup software](/docs/software-setup.md)
3. Run, record
4. Training
  Hit record button while driving. A pair of image and json file including steering angle, speed will be produce for each frame. Record folder located at `noahcar/autorc/training-set/` copy to your PC for training.
  - Write new model: [Noahcar.ipynb](/docs/Noahcar.ipynb)
  - [Transfer leaning](/docs/transfer.md)
5. Autopilot


## Run
```
cd noahcar
. env/bin/activate
python manage.py start
# Or
./manage.py -p <profile_name> start
```
